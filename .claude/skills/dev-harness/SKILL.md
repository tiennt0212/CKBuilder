description: Autonomous OODA-loop harness for building and fixing CKBuilder features (Next.js pages, UI components, CKB interactions). Spawns isolated sub-agents for Planner → Implementer → Checker → Eval → PR, sharing state via disk. Use when the user says "build", "add a feature", "fix", "create a page", "create a component", or gives any implementation task for the CKBuilder app. Do NOT trigger for pure Q&A, code review, or read-only exploration.

# dev-harness — CKBuilder Feature Development Harness

This skill runs an autonomous OODA loop, spawning isolated sub-agents for each phase
and sharing state through files on disk. The loop continues until all checks pass
or `max_iterations` is reached.

**Why sub-agents?** Each phase needs a clean context window. The Implementer must not
see the Planner's reasoning noise; the Checker must not inherit partial edits as
assumptions. Context isolation prevents cross-phase contamination.

**Why harness-state.json?** State on disk is inspectable, resumable, and survives
context compaction. Sub-agents get deterministic, structured input — not a reconstructed
summary of prior turns.

**Skill layout:**
```

## Arguments

`$ARGUMENTS` — required. Syntax: `[--auto] <task description>`

- `--auto` (optional): suppresses all human checkpoints; runs phases back-to-back.
- `<task description>`: what to build or fix. Examples: "add a Transfer page at
  /transfer", "fix the CellChip story", "add a useBalance hook to app/features/".

If no task is provided, ask once before proceeding.

---

## Step 0 — Parse arguments and initialize state

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`: if the first token is `--auto`, set `auto = true` and strip it.
The remainder is the task. If task is empty, ask: "What should the harness build or fix?"

**Derive a timestamp:**
```bash
date -Iseconds | sed 's/://g' | sed 's/+.*$//'
```
This produces e.g. `20260502T192516`. Use it as `<timestamp>`.

**Create run directory:** `.claude/harness/<timestamp>/`. Store as `<run-dir>`.

Write `<run-dir>/harness-state.json`:

```json
{
  "task": "<task from arguments>",
  "phase": "planner",
  "iteration": 0,
  "max_iterations": 5,
  "auto": false,
  "run_dir": "<run-dir>",
  "tier": "",
  "feature_type": "",
  "target_files": [],
  "artifacts": [],
  "errors": [],
  "context_log": [],
  "eval_scores": {},
  "pr_description": "",
  "started_at": "<ISO8601 from: date -Iseconds>",
  "updated_at": "<ISO8601 from: date -Iseconds>"
}
```

`feature_type` values: `"page"`, `"ui-component"`, `"store"`, `"lib"`, `"contract"`, `"mixed"`

`tier` values: `"lab-spike"`, `"polished"` — the Planner resolves this (see `agents/planner.md`)
and every later phase reads it. It selects which Definition of Done gates apply.

Error object shape:
```json
{ "iteration": 0, "type": "build | lint | structural", "severity": "ERROR | WARN", "file": "", "message": "" }
```

Proceed to Step 1.

---

## Step 1 — Planner phase

Read `agents/planner.md`. Replace every `{run_dir}` with `<run-dir>` and `{iteration}`
with `0`. Spawn a sub-agent using the Agent tool with the resulting text as the prompt.

After the agent returns, confirm `feature_type` and `target_files` are populated in
state and that `<run-dir>/harness-brief.md` exists.

If `auto = false`: show "Planner complete. Review `<run-dir>/harness-brief.md` then reply 'continue'." Wait.

---

## Step 2 — Implementer phase (loop entry)

Read state. Note current `iteration` value (`N`).

Read `agents/implementer.md`. Replace `{run_dir}` → `<run-dir>` and `{iteration}` → `N`.
Spawn a sub-agent with the resulting text as the prompt.

If `auto = false`: show "Implementer complete (iteration `N`). Reply 'continue' to run Checker." Wait.

Proceed to Step 3.

---

## Step 3 — Checker phase

Read `agents/checker.md`. Replace `{run_dir}` → `<run-dir>` and `{iteration}` → `N`.
Spawn a sub-agent with the resulting text as the prompt.

After it returns, proceed to Step 4 (orchestrator reads state directly).

---

## Step 4 — Decision gate (orchestrator only — do not spawn a sub-agent)

Read `<run-dir>/harness-state.json`. Apply this logic:

```
current_errors = [e for e in errors if e.iteration == N and e.severity == "ERROR"]

if len(current_errors) == 0:
    set phase = "eval" → write state → proceed to Step 5

elif N >= max_iterations - 1:
    set phase = "done" → write state
    print "Harness stopped: max iterations reached."
    print remaining ERRORs
    STOP

else:
    increment iteration → set phase = "implementer" → write state
    if auto == false: print error count, ask user to reply 'continue'
    jump to Step 2
```

WARNs do not trigger re-implementation. They are recorded and surfaced in the PR.

---

## Step 5 — Eval phase

Read `agents/eval.md`. Replace `{run_dir}` → `<run-dir>` and `{iteration}` → `N`.
Spawn a sub-agent with the resulting text as the prompt.

If `auto = false`: show "Eval complete. Review `eval_scores` in state. Reply 'continue'." Wait.

---

## Step 6 — PR Draft phase

Read `agents/pr.md`. Replace `{run_dir}` → `<run-dir>` and `{iteration}` → `N`.
Spawn a sub-agent with the resulting text as the prompt.

---

## Step 7 — Completion

Read `<run-dir>/harness-state.json`. Print:

```
Harness complete after <iteration+1> iteration(s).
Stage these files for commit:
<all artifact file paths, one per line>

--- PR DESCRIPTION ---
<pr_description field>

--- CONTEXT LOG ---
<for each entry in context_log:>
[<phase>] iter=<N>  files=<count>  skills=<names or "none">  mcp=<tool@server or "none">
```

The run directory `.claude/harness/<timestamp>/` is ephemeral — delete after PR merges.

## Error reference

| Situation | Orchestrator action |
|---|---|
| Planner returns without `harness-brief.md` | Stop. Do not proceed with missing brief. |
| Checker returns without updating `errors` | Treat as 0 errors, proceed to Eval. |
| PR agent returns with "PR BLOCKED" | Print blocker list. Stop. |
| Max iterations reached | Print remaining errors. Stop. |
| `harness-state.json` missing at phase entry | Stop and ask user to re-run: `/dev-harness [--auto] <task>` |
